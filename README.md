The available functionality is currently limited to the RunControl panel, a basic cell builder, a simplified point process manager that lets you inject a current clamp and space plot functionality.

This prototype is being developed in collaboration with the [Neurosim Lab](http://neurosimlab.org/) and the [Sense Lab](https://senselab.med.yale.edu/).

The UI connects to [nrnpython](http://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/static/docs/help/neuron/neuron/classes/python.html) through a [Geppetto](http://git.geppetto.org) extension for [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter.org/).
